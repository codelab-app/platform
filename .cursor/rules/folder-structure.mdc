- I'm using an nx mono repo where /apps and /libs hold most of the code
- /apps/web is the main web repo, and most routes are in /apps/web/app/(dashboard)/(authenticated)
- Under (authenticated), we have admin, apps, atoms, auth-guards, components, resources, tags, types
- For each module, if there are parallel slots (header, modal, primarySideabr, secondaryPopover, configPane), we will use DashboardLayout
- layout.tsx should either use DashboardLayoutProps if using slots, or LayoutProps if not using slots
- We split the libs into frontend and backend, /libs/frontend, /libs/backend
- The within each will be split into application and domain
