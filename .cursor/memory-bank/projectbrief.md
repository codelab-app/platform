# Project Brief: No-Code UI Builder with GraphQL Integration

_Version: 1.0_
_Created: 2023-05-07_
_Last Updated: 2023-05-07_

## Project Overview

A no-code builder platform that allows developers to create UI trees with GraphQL data structure integration and a system of props passing for data binding. The platform enables construction of complex UIs by assembling both atomic UI components (from frameworks like Ant Design) and custom composite components.

## Core Requirements

- Create UI DOM trees using UI framework component integration
- Support atomic components (UI framework elements like Ant Design) and composite components (custom DOM trees)
- Implement data binding through props passing
- Integrate with GraphQL data structures
- Provide a SaaS model for developer users

## Success Criteria

- Developers can create complete UIs without writing code
- Components can be nested and reused efficiently
- Data binding works seamlessly with GraphQL
- UI state management is traceable and debuggable
- The platform is intuitive enough for developers to adopt quickly

## Scope

### In Scope

- UI builder interface
- Component library integration (Ant Design and others)
- GraphQL data structure integration
- Props system for data binding
- Component hierarchy management

### Out of Scope

- Deployment of created applications (initially)
- CI/CD integration
- Advanced authentication systems
- Multi-user collaboration features

## Timeline

- Initial prototype: Already exceeded 3 months
- Core functionality release: TBD
- Advanced features (backend builder): TBD

## Stakeholders

- Developer users: Primary users of the platform
- Platform administrators: Managing the SaaS service
- UI framework providers: Component sources

## Technical Challenges

- Complex domain modeling
- UI state management with MobX is difficult to trace
- Maintaining clear data flow in deeply nested component structures
