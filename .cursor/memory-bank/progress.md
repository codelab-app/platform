- State Management Improvements: MEDIUM - Needed for better debugging
- Component Library Expansion: MEDIUM - More component types needed
- Serverless Function Builder: LOW - Future feature after core functionality

## Known Issues

- MobX State Tracing: HIGH - Difficult to trace state updates in complex component trees
- Component Nesting: MEDIUM - Performance issues with deeply nested components
- GraphQL Schema Generation: MEDIUM - Some complex types not properly converted
- UI Builder Performance: LOW - Slowdown with many components on canvas

## Milestones

- Core Component System: 2023-Q3 - IN PROGRESS
- Data Binding MVP: 2023-Q3 - NOT STARTED
- UI Builder Interface: 2023-Q4 - IN PROGRESS
- Performance Optimization: 2023-Q4 - NOT STARTED
