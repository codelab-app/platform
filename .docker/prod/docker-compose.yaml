# `--env-file`, a flag for docker-compose, is used for variable substitution
#
# `env_file` is used to find env to inject into docker container at runtime

#
# When you use a bind mount, as in your example, Docker doesn't create a named volume. Instead, it directly maps the file or directory from your host machine into the container. In this case, ./prometheus.yaml from your local machine is being mounted to /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml within the container.
