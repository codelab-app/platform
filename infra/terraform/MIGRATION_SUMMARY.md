# Terraform Symlink Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the Terraform symlink refactoring completed as part of issue #3773.

## What Was Done

### 1. Module Refactoring
Successfully refactored 6 infrastructure modules to use explicit variable inputs:
- `codelab` - Core infrastructure (VPC, DNS, Certificate, Registry)
- `codelab-api` - API service deployment
- `codelab-web` - Web application deployment
- `codelab-neo4j` - Neo4j database deployment
- `codelab-sites` - Preview environments deployment
- `codelab-landing` - Landing page deployment

Each module now:
- Has a proper `variables.tf` file with all required inputs
- Uses lowercase variable names (Terraform convention)
- No longer depends on symlinks
- Has clear dependencies declared as inputs

### 2. Environment Migration
Successfully migrated all 4 environments to the new pattern:
- `dev` - Development environment
- `test` - Test environment  
- `prod` - Production environment
- `ci` - CI/CD environment

Each environment now has:
- `variables.tf` - UPPERCASE variables matching Terraform Cloud
- `modules.tf` - Consolidated module definitions with explicit variable passing
- No symlinks or symlink.sh scripts

### 3. Variable Naming Convention
Established clear pattern:
- **Environment level**: UPPERCASE variables (from Terraform Cloud)
- **Module level**: lowercase variables (Terraform standard)
- **Translation**: Happens in environment `modules.tf` files

Example:
```hcl
# In environments/dev/variables.tf
variable "AUTH0_DOMAIN" {
  type = string
}

# In environments/dev/modules.tf
module "shared_config" {
  auth0_domain = var.AUTH0_DOMAIN  # UPPERCASE â†’ lowercase
}
```

### 4. Infrastructure Updates
- Updated Terraform CLI service to remove symlink execution
- Created shared-config module for centralized configuration
- Added missing module outputs (e.g., codelab_api_hostname)
- Removed all environment-level symlink.sh scripts

## What Remains

### Modules Still Using Symlinks
The following modules still need refactoring:
- `auth0` - Auth0 provider configuration (still has 2 symlinked files)
- `circleci` - CircleCI context configuration (still has 19 symlinked files)
- `circleci-docker` - CircleCI Docker context (has symlinked files)

**IMPORTANT**: These modules still have symlink.sh scripts and symlinked .tf files, but the scripts are no longer executed since we removed symlink execution from the Terraform CLI service. These modules will need to be properly refactored before they can work correctly. Currently they may be missing required variables.

### Benefits Achieved
1. **No more OS-dependent symlinks** - Works on all platforms
2. **Clear dependency chains** - Explicit module connections
3. **Better maintainability** - Standard Terraform patterns
4. **Improved readability** - Clear variable flow
5. **Terraform Cloud ready** - Proper variable naming

### Next Steps
1. Test `terraform plan` in each environment to ensure no infrastructure changes
2. Update CI/CD pipelines if they reference symlink scripts
3. Consider refactoring remaining modules (auth0, circleci)
4. Clean up `environments/shared` directory after confirming it's no longer needed

## Migration Validation
Before applying any changes, validate with:
```bash
terraform plan
```

The plan should show no infrastructure changes, only configuration updates.
