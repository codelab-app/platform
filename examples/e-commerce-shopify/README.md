# e-commerce site using shopify storefront api

This is an attempt to replicate the mock e-commerce site from vercel: https://demo.vercel.store/search

## Features

- Fetch products from storefront
- Cart functionality
- Checkout using the checkoutUrl from the cart

## Local setup

You will need a store id from shopify. You can create one for free and use it.
