        A Page composed of Element nodes. Think of Element nodes as DOM nodes
        within a page. But Element doesn't contain any node type information on
        it, it only tells us the location within the dom tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Element is a self-referencing. Ideally, the schema should only have 1
        Element node, with an arc to itself (couldn't get it working)
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is why we need a Component node, this tells us the type of the
        node it is.
      </p>
      <Row style={{ width: '100%' }}>
        <Col span={12}>
          <D3Graph {...pageSchema} width={400} height={400} />

            Imagine each element node points to another Component of the label
            type (not pictured here to save space) <br />
            The Component node gives the Element the type
          </p>
