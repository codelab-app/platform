# Documentation Conventions

When creating documentation for complex implementations that span multiple files:

- Save documentation summaries in `.claude/documentation/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames like `feature-name-implementation.md`
- This keeps implementation docs separate from the main codebase
- Only create these when the implementation is complex or non-obvious
- Examples: multi-file refactors, new architectural patterns, debugging solutions
