# Default GitHub Repository for Issues

When creating GitHub issues, use the following repository by default:

- **Owner**: codelab-app
- **Repository**: platform
- **Full URL**: https://github.com/codelab-app/platform

This is the main repository for the Codelab platform project. All issues related to the codebase should be created here unless explicitly specified otherwise by the user.
