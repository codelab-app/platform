# Circular Dependency Resolution - Lessons Learned

## What I Missed

1. **Obvious Solution**: When encountering a circular dependency between `backend-infra-adapter-graphql` and `backend-infra-adapter-neo4j-schema` modules, I should have immediately recognized that the dataloader functionality was a distinct concern that deserved its own module.

2. **Domain Separation**: The dataloader is a separate infrastructure concern from GraphQL itself. It should have been in its own adapter module from the beginning, following the project's clear separation of concerns pattern.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: The project structure already follows a pattern of separating adapters:
   - `backend-infra-adapter-graphql`
   - `backend-infra-adapter-neo4j-driver`
   - `backend-infra-adapter-neo4j-schema`
   - `backend-infra-adapter-logger`
   
   A `backend-infra-adapter-dataloader` fits perfectly into this pattern.

## Why I Missed It

1. **Tunnel Vision**: I focused on solving the immediate circular dependency by moving interfaces around rather than stepping back to see the architectural issue.

2. **Quick Fix Mentality**: I attempted band-aid solutions (using `any` type, moving interfaces) instead of addressing the root cause - improper module organization.

3. **Not Following DDD Principles**: The project follows Domain-Driven Design, where each adapter should have a single responsibility. DataLoader is a distinct concern from GraphQL schema generation.

## How to Do Better Next Time

1. **First Question**: When encountering circular dependencies, always ask: "Are these modules properly separated by concern?"

2. **Check Existing Patterns**: Look at how similar functionality is organized in the codebase before proposing solutions.

3. **Suggest Refactoring Early**: When code is in the wrong place, suggest moving it to a proper module immediately rather than working around the issue.

4. **Architecture Over Hacks**: Prioritize clean architecture solutions over quick fixes, even if they require more initial setup.

## Key Takeaway

When modules have circular dependencies, it often indicates that functionality is in the wrong place. The solution is usually to extract the shared functionality into a separate module, not to hack around the dependency with type gymnastics.
