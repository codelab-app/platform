# Library

A `Library` is the abstraction for which all that we need to build a UI.

Just as Ant Design is a library that consists of re-useable components, we use that same concept.

```typescript
interface Library {
  components: Component[]
}
```

Antd Design contain interfaces for props, which are represented as propTypes. Along with default props that we attach to `ComponentElement`

```typescript
interface Library {
  propTypes: PropTypeC
  props: PropC
}
```
